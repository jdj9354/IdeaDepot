Adds a Color Picker Field type to the Advanced Fields in Formidable Pro 

== Description ==

This Plugin is an experiment, I needed to let users pick colors for entries intended to be displayed in a Calendar View. I discovered a workaround on the [Formidable Web Site](https://formidablepro.com/adding-a-color-picker-field/) that was a few years old, so I decided to grab the current version of [jscolor](http://jscolor.com/) and put it in a plugin for easier deployment.

Along the way I discovered a few other color picker libraries for jQuery, so when I get around to it I'll add them to the plugin to give users some different display options.

**Please Note:** *This plugin requires the Formidable Pro Plugin (https://formidablepro.com/) by [Strategy11 ](http://strategy11.com/)to be installed and activated before installation. Formidable Pro is an awesome plugin.*

== Installation ==

1. Upload `formidable-color-picker.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and unzip it there, or use the WordPress Dashboard to install it.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create your forms as usual and use the Color Picker Field type in the Advanced Fields section to add Color Picker Fields

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I want a color picker? =

You may wish to give users the option of selecting colors. For instance, when creating a recurring entry in a calendar, you might want the user to be able to select a color for their entry so it's easy to see among others.

Any time you want users to be able to select colors for elements, use a color picker field, and then insert the value of that field as a style attribute or an inline style in a view. You could even create a view that's nothing but a style sheet with dynamic values from your form. The possibilities are endless, really.

= Why is this so simple? =

It fixes a simple problem.

= Can I have more than one Color Picker Field in a Form? =

You can.

= What about more display options? =

Those will come later.
